# Introduction
This is a react project I created for my dad to manage his GST reports easily. This doesn't do much except for keep a list of sheets and those contain entries for each transaction.
This is different from using spreadsheets as it's minimal and easily accessible from mobile browser.

Features:
* Create sheets for each month/report.
* Edit and delete entries and sheets.
* Download sheets as csv.


Next steps:

* Add better UI
* Add tests
* Add welcome page
* Move to render props for loading.


# Instructions

1. build: `yarn build` or `npm run build`
2. start development server: `yarn start` or `npm run start`
